# 🧠 Artificial Neural Network (ANN) – Classification Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** to solve a **classification problem**.  
The model learns complex patterns from input features and classifies data into predefined categories using supervised learning.
